## Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

We need to identify customers who are likely to churn in future, given the previous months data to predict
We need to define this churn only in high value customers
In the given data there are three phases in the data, the good phase, action phase and churn phase
we have to make use of the good an daction phase to predict the churn
Steps of Approach

1. Reading data
2. Missing Value data
3. High value customers
4. Tagging churn vs non-churn
5. EDA
6. Model building
7. Business Recomendations
